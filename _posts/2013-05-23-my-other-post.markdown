You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
function (foo) {
  console.log("Snapdoodle");
  return (function (parse) {
    return parse.toJSON() + footerString;
  })
}
{% endhighlight %}
